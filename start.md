# Getting Started

I highly recommend you install `SublimeText3` before you go and jump into the installation process.
Reason being, it will give you command line editor access (`subl`) which we will need to edit various files.

[update](_update.md ':include')

> NOTE: We will have to run this command before each step just to be sure.

Besides PHP, all the other installations are same accross all the 
ubuntu versions so I will create only one section for them.

For `php` I will create 2 seperate sections for each ubuntu versions. Ubuntu 14 & 16 has the same flow. Only 17 is Slightly different.
